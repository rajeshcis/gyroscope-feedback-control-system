# gyroscope-feedback-control-system

This code contains a real time gyroscope feedback system code that is controlling/calibrating servo motor to maintain parallax with ground using data which is fed from gyroscope to arduino.

Designed mathematical algorithm to convert data fed by gyroscope to angle for servo motors to maintain their position.

This code is used for arduino uno microcontroller board for reading gyroscope data and calculating angle made by gyroscope board to ground and in real time arduino set servo to maintain its axis with ground.

Language used to write this code are Arduino C and Embedded C.
